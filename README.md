## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    In creating this submission, the most challenging part was probably adding the hidden image to the game so that when the buttons were pressed, the image would appear. 
    It seemed a bit confusing at first, so I reread the instructions in order to think of possible ways to approach the problem. Since I didn't know much about the img tag or images on html
    in general, I opted to do my own research online to play aroun with different ways of adding an image to an html site. Luckily since there are so amny easy resources to find, I took the general
    knowledge I gathered during my research and applied it to the project in order to try to make it work. Along the way, I tested each edit I made to my code to see how it would affect my website so
    I could debug very easily. When I was satisfied that the image only appeared when I clicked on any of the buttons, I moved on to the next task. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  After completing this submission, I am wonddering about the limits of what you can add into websites and how the different languages work together. I have only worked on projects in which
  I am only using one language at a time, so I am interested in how html,js, and css can all be used together to create interesting and innovative websites.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add several other functions. Firstly, I would implement the ticking counter that was suggested. Second, I would try to make a display for how
    many strikes I currently had (When I was test playing, this bugged me a bit). I would also like to display how many tiles were in the sequence and where my current progress was in the game. 
    Additionally, I'd add a visible timer to see how much time was left for each turn. I would also look into a system in which there is a history of scores and the best score is displayed on screen.
